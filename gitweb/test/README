# JavaScript tests for gitweb

Gitweb uses Jasmine[1], a BDD framework for JavaScript tests. Tests can be run
in a console with node.js[2] producing TAP output or in the browser at
`test/SpecRunner.html`. Additional requirements are npm[3] and
jasmine-tapreporter[4]

The specs are written in `test/spec` as `foo.spec.js` for the source file
`foo.js`.`t/t9503-gitweb-javascript.js` will be generated with a Makefile to run
the tests in the console with nodejs and to report results in TAP format.

## Work to do :

1. Provision to skip the test if dependencies are not installed.
2. Installing browser tests optionally.
