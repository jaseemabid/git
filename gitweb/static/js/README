# GIT web interface (gitweb) - JavaScript

This directory holds JavaScript code used by gitweb (GIT web interface).
Scripts here will be concatenated in the order by gitweb/Makefile into
gitweb/static/gitweb.js

See also comments in gitweb/Makefile.

Care to be taken in the order of JavaScript files in gitweb/Makefile.


Files to be built, in order :

dateTime.js     : All date manipulation code goes here.
timeZones.js    : List of time zones for popup selector
cookies.js      : Cookies for persistent storage
persist.js      : Persistent storage with cookies and localStorage
app.js          : All UI for gitweb


## JavaScript tests for gitweb

Gitweb uses mocha[1] framework for JavaScript tests. Tests can be run in a
console with node.js[2] producing TAP output or in the browser at
`test/SpecRunner.html`. Additional requirements are listed in
/gitweb/static/js/package.json and can be installed with npm[3] by
$ `npm install` inside gitweb/static/js

The specs are written in `gitweb/static/js/test` as `foo.spec.js` for the source
file `foo.js`.[TODO] `t/t9503-gitweb-javascript.js` will be generated with a
Makefile to run the tests in the console with nodejs and to report results in
TAP format integrating with the existing tests.

### Work to do :

1. Provision to skip the test if dependencies are not installed.
2. Installing browser tests optionally.
3. Generating `t/t9503-gitweb-javascript.js`
